## Frontend Software Engineer - Technical Challenge

### Interview purpose

You will be asked to share your screen and think aloud while you resolve a programming challenge. The purpose of the exercise is to understand your thought process and how you put your ideas into code. So don't stay silent and speak your mind. You are allowed to search the internet for libraries' documentation, as you would be in real life.

### Technical considerations

Right now the web app is showing a simple list of all Rick and Morty Characters. This data comes from the follow API endpoint `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/`

1. **We expect** that you develop a simple Pagination component that allows user to navigate across the full list of characters per pages. You are free to take any UX decisions. You could check this Doc for more information `https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character-schema`
